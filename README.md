# Image-Classifer
A simple image classifier training framework using Keras. This uses a batch approach to reduce the amount of memory used, though I am sure there is a much better and more efficient way to do so.

## Instruction to use
1. Create folders each containing photos of one class. 
2. Add the folder names into the "class_names" list in the beginning of the training file.
3. Run training.py
4. Run classify.py

Simple as that!!
